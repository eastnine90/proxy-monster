// Acceptance is a signed, permanent record that an operator ACCEPTED a specific chain divergence rather than
// restoring the trail. It waives exactly one divergence, identified down to the bytes that disagreed, so it
// can never be read as blanket permission for a different break.
//
// It is a record ADDED to the store, never a replacement of anything: an acceptance and an anchor are
// different objects under different prefixes, so accepting a break can never overwrite the signed anchor that
// witnessed it. That separation is the point — the anchor is the evidence, and evidence must outlive the
// decision to move on from it.

	Actual      string `json:"actual"`   // hex; the hash it actually had
	// ResumeHash is the head the walk adopts to continue PAST this divergence: the row_hash actually stored at
	// DivergentID. Verification needs it to keep checking rows above an accepted break instead of stopping at
	// it forever — an accepted break must not blind the monitor to later tampering.
